A simple widget and shortcut icon for the screencasting Miracast feature enabled in Android devices in Android 4.2+

For Christmas 2013, I got a Netgear Push2TV box that allows me to mirror my display wirelessly from my Nexus 5. But... the setting to do this was four or five clicks from the home screen. I wanted a shorcut so I could do this faster, so I made one!

This project includes one simple Activity that simply opens the settings menu to the correct Activity to choose a display and cast your screen. It also includes a widget that can open that settings screen with one click, and list the device you are streaming to if Miracast is currently enabled.

This app is available on Google Play here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mattgmg.miracastwidget
